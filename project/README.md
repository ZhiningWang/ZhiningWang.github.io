###Restaurants Operating during Covid

Introduction
The goal of the project is to provide a platform that allows users to search information about restaurants that operate during the pandemic in the Seattle area, allows the business owners to input new data and other related information into the database as well as stores and updates the data for other interactive uses. In addition, further goals of the project would be to help out people and restaurants that are in need (as well as other business if more data is available). What is more, I also think it is possible for the project to be developed into a mobile app that centers on covid time lifestyle or be integrated into bigger mobile services such as Google Map and Yelp to provide more accurate and up-to-date information. In the following paragraphs, I will talk about the audiences, data and reflection of the project and demonstrate the design and functions of the web map too.

Data
According to the Seattle government, the data covers “restaurants, bars, cafes, and breweries in King, Pierce, and Snohomish counties” and is compiled from “publicly available sources and from self-reporting by business owners through a survey hosted by the City of Seattle, along with the he original dataset that is part of the City’s #SupportSeattleSmallBiz campaign, for restaurants, bars, cafes, and breweries that are doing delivery, to-go, and drive-through”.
The data was created on Oct 16, 2020 and last updated on Jan 1, 2021.

Webmap
The web map is implemented using web programing languages such as html, css and javascript. The fundamental framework is based on Bootstrap, a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development that contains CSS- and JavaScript-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.

Major functions
-enable the input of restaurants data
-store the restaurants dataset
-visualize the dataset and provide data insight
-enable the search of restaurants and related information
-display the locations of restaurants on a dynamic map

Elements
-scalar bar: located at bottom left, display the scale in both metrics and miles
-zoom: located at bottom right, “+” represents zoom in and “-” represents zoom out
-legend: located rat bottom right, change with data selection(for example, in “u-district” map layer, all the locations are marked in green which will be specified in the legend)
